### New Features introduced in Java 8

> Default and static methods in interfaces
> Lambda Expressions
> @Functional Interface
> forEach() method
> Stream API
> LocalDate, LocalTime, LocalDateTime


1. Why default method introduced in intefaces ?
    * Before Java8, interfaces contains only abstract method. All methods are by default public and abstract 
    * With Java 8, default method introduced
    * This helps in achieving of a new method in interfaces without need to change existing classes.
2. Why static method introduced in interfaces?
    * If you want to provide a default implementation, which cannot be change.
    * Static method cannot be overridden
    * Access vis inteface name or object of class implementing inteface.
3. What are the features of Java8, you have used in your project?
    * LocalDate, Stream API, Lambda Expression, forEach(), @Functional Interface
    * Lambda expressions are, basically functions with no name and identifiers. Promotes functional programming. It helps in expressing instances of single-method class more compactly.
4. What is the advantage of using new Date Api?
    * Before Java 8, we do not have support for timezone. We have to programmatically change the time-zone.
    * Java8, introduced support for timezone.
    * Import classes most frequently used:
        * LocalDate, LocalDateTime, ZonedDateTime
    * Other classes are:
        * Clock, LocalTime, Duration
5. @Functional Interface
    * @Functional Interface, if used, will force the compiler to check whether the give interface has single-abstract method or not.
    * If not, compiler will throw error "Unexpected @Functionalinterface anotation"
    
7. ```java 
    List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
    list.forEach(elem -> {System.out.println(elem)});
    
    
    List<User> list = new ArrayList<>();
    list.forEach(user -> {
        System.out.println(user.getId());
        System.out.println(user.getName());
    });
    
    // various forms of lambda expressions
    () -> expression
    (parameters) -> expression
    (parameters) -> {multiple statements}
    ```


### How streams work
A stream represents a sequence of elements and supports different kind of operations to perform computations upon those elements:

```java
List<String> myList =
    Arrays.asList("a1", "a2", "b1", "c2", "c1");

myList
    .stream()
    .filter(s -> s.startsWith("c"))
    .map(String::toUpperCase)
    .sorted()
    .forEach(System.out::println);

// C1
// C2
```

Stream operations are either **intermediate** or **terminal**. 
* Intermediate operations return a stream so we can chain multiple intermediate operations without using semicolons. 
* Terminal operations are either void or return a non-stream result. 

In the above example `filter`, `map` and `sorted` are **intermediate operations** whereas `forEach` is a **terminal operation**. For a full list of all available stream operations see the [Stream Javadoc](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html). Such a chain of stream operations as seen in the example above is also known as operation pipeline.

### Different kind of streams
Streams can be created from various data sources, especially collections. Lists and Sets support new methods `stream()` and `parallelStream()` to either create a sequential or a parallel stream. Parallel streams are capable of operating on multiple threads.


sequential streams:
```java
Arrays.asList("a1", "a2", "a3")
    .stream()
    .findFirst()
    .ifPresent(System.out::println);  // a1
```

* Calling the method `stream()` on a list of objects returns a regular object stream. Just use `Stream.of()`
```java
Stream.of("a1", "a2", "a3")
    .findFirst()
    .ifPresent(System.out::println);  // a1
```

Besides regular object streams Java 8 ships with special kinds of streams for working with the primitive data types int, long and double. We have `IntStream`, `LongStream` and `DoubleStream`.
```java
IntStream.range(1, 4)
    .forEach(System.out::println);

// 1
// 2
// 3


// 
// mapToInt()
Stream.of("a1", "a2", "a3")
    .map(s -> s.substring(1))
    .mapToInt(Integer::parseInt)
    .max()
    .ifPresent(System.out::println);  // 3
    
    
// 
// mapToObj()
IntStream.range(1, 4)
    .mapToObj(i -> "a" + i)
    .forEach(System.out::println);

// a1
// a2
// a3   
    
    
//
//
Stream.of(1.0, 2.0, 3.0)
    .mapToInt(Double::intValue)
    .mapToObj(i -> "a" + i)
    .forEach(System.out::println);

// a1
// a2
// a3
    
```


### Processing Order
* An important characteristic of intermediate operations is laziness.
```java
Stream.of("d2", "a2", "b1", "b3", "c")
    .filter(s -> {
        System.out.println("filter: " + s);
        return true;
    });
```
When executing this code snippet, nothing is printed to the console. That is because intermediate operations will only be executed when a terminal operation is present.
```java
Stream.of("d2", "a2", "b1", "b3", "c")
    .filter(s -> {
        System.out.println("filter: " + s);
        return true;
    })
    .forEach(s -> System.out.println("forEach: " + s));
```
Executing this code snippet results in the desired output on the console:
```
filter:  d2
forEach: d2
filter:  a2
forEach: a2
filter:  b1
forEach: b1
filter:  b3
forEach: b3
filter:  c
forEach: c
```
The order of the result might be surprising. A naive approach would be to execute the operations horizontally one after another on all elements of the stream. But instead each element moves along the chain vertically. The first string "d2" passes filter then forEach, only then the second string "a2" is processed.

This behavior can reduce the actual number of operations performed on each element, as we see in the next example:
```java
Stream.of("d2", "a2", "b1", "b3", "c")
    .map(s -> {
        System.out.println("map: " + s);
        return s.toUpperCase();
    })
    .anyMatch(s -> {
        System.out.println("anyMatch: " + s);
        return s.startsWith("A");
    });

// map:      d2
// anyMatch: D2
// map:      a2
// anyMatch: A2
```
The operation `anyMatch` returns true as soon as the predicate applies to the given input element. This is true for the second element passed "A2". Due to the vertical execution of the stream chain, map has only to be executed twice in this case. So instead of mapping all elements of the stream, map will be called as few as possible.


### Why order matters
Two intermediate operations `map` and `filter` and the terminal operation `forEach`. 
Let's once again inspect how those operations are being executed:
```java
Stream.of("d2", "a2", "b1", "b3", "c")
    .map(s -> {
        System.out.println("map: " + s);
        return s.toUpperCase();
    })
    .filter(s -> {
        System.out.println("filter: " + s);
        return s.startsWith("A");
    })
    .forEach(s -> System.out.println("forEach: " + s));

// map:     d2
// filter:  D2
// map:     a2
// filter:  A2
// forEach: A2
// map:     b1
// filter:  B1
// map:     b3
// filter:  B3
// map:     c
// filter:  C
```
As you might have guessed both `map` and `filter` are called five times for every string in the underlying collection whereas `forEach` is only called once.

We can greatly reduce the actual number of executions if we change the order of the operations, moving `filter` to the beginning of the chain:
```java
Stream.of("d2", "a2", "b1", "b3", "c")
    .filter(s -> {
        System.out.println("filter: " + s);
        return s.startsWith("a");
    })
    .map(s -> {
        System.out.println("map: " + s);
        return s.toUpperCase();
    })
    .forEach(s -> System.out.println("forEach: " + s));

// filter:  d2
// filter:  a2
// map:     a2
// forEach: A2
// filter:  b1
// filter:  b3
// filter:  c
```
Now, `map` is only called once so the operation pipeline performs much faster for larger numbers of input elements. Keep that in mind when composing complex method chains.


Let's extend the above example by an additional operation, `sorted`:
```java
Stream.of("d2", "a2", "b1", "b3", "c")
    .sorted((s1, s2) -> {
        System.out.printf("sort: %s; %s\n", s1, s2);
        return s1.compareTo(s2);
    })
    .filter(s -> {
        System.out.println("filter: " + s);
        return s.startsWith("a");
    })
    .map(s -> {
        System.out.println("map: " + s);
        return s.toUpperCase();
    })
    .forEach(s -> System.out.println("forEach: " + s));
```
`Sorting` is a special kind of **intermediate operation**. It's a so called stateful operation since in order to sort a collection of elements you have to maintain state during ordering.


Executing this example results in the following console output:
```java
sort:    a2; d2
sort:    b1; a2
sort:    b1; d2
sort:    b1; a2
sort:    b3; b1
sort:    b3; d2
sort:    c; b3
sort:    c; d2
filter:  a2
map:     a2
forEach: A2
filter:  b1
filter:  b3
filter:  c
filter:  d2
```
First, the sort operation is executed on the entire input collection. In other words `sorted` is executed horizontally. So in this case sorted is called eight times for multiple combinations on every element in the input collection.

Once again we can optimize the performance by reordering the chain:
```java
Stream.of("d2", "a2", "b1", "b3", "c")
    .filter(s -> {
        System.out.println("filter: " + s);
        return s.startsWith("a");
    })
    .sorted((s1, s2) -> {
        System.out.printf("sort: %s; %s\n", s1, s2);
        return s1.compareTo(s2);
    })
    .map(s -> {
        System.out.println("map: " + s);
        return s.toUpperCase();
    })
    .forEach(s -> System.out.println("forEach: " + s));

// filter:  d2
// filter:  a2
// filter:  b1
// filter:  b3
// filter:  c
// map:     a2
// forEach: A2
```
In this example sorted is never been called because filter reduces the input collection to just one element. So the performance is greatly increased for larger input collections.

### Reusing Streams
Java 8 streams cannot be reused. As soon as you call any terminal operation the stream is closed:
```java
Stream<String> stream =
    Stream.of("d2", "a2", "b1", "b3", "c")
        .filter(s -> s.startsWith("a"));

stream.anyMatch(s -> true);    // ok
stream.noneMatch(s -> true);   // exception
```
Calling `noneMatch` after `anyMatch` on the same stream results in the following exception:
```java
java.lang.IllegalStateException: stream has already been operated upon or closed
    at java.util.stream.AbstractPipeline.evaluate(AbstractPipeline.java:229)
    at java.util.stream.ReferencePipeline.noneMatch(ReferencePipeline.java:459)
    at com.winterbe.java8.Streams5.test7(Streams5.java:38)
    at com.winterbe.java8.Streams5.main(Streams5.java:28)
```
To overcome this limitation we have to to create a new stream chain for every terminal operation we want to execute, e.g. we could create a stream supplier to construct a new stream with all intermediate operations already set up:
```java
Supplier<Stream<String>> streamSupplier =
    () -> Stream.of("d2", "a2", "b1", "b3", "c")
            .filter(s -> s.startsWith("a"));

streamSupplier.get().anyMatch(s -> true);   // ok
streamSupplier.get().noneMatch(s -> true);  // ok
```
Each call to `get()` constructs a new stream on which we are save to call the desired terminal operation.


### Advanced Operations
```java
class Person {
    String name;
    int age;

    Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return name;
    }
}

List<Person> persons =
    Arrays.asList(
        new Person("Max", 18),
        new Person("Peter", 23),
        new Person("Pamela", 23),
        new Person("David", 12));
 ```
 
 #### Collect
 Collect is an extremely useful **terminal operation** to transform the elements of the stream into a different kind of result, e.g. a `List`, `Set` or `Map`. 
 * Collect accepts a Collector which consists of four different operations: a supplier, an accumulator, a combiner and a finisher. 
 * This sounds super complicated at first, but the good part is Java 8 supports various built-in collectors via the Collectors class. So for the most common operations you don't have to implement a collector yourself.
 
```java
List<Person> filtered =
    persons
        .stream()
        .filter(p -> p.name.startsWith("P"))
        .collect(Collectors.toList());

System.out.println(filtered);    // [Peter, Pamela]

//As you can see it's very simple to construct a list from the elements of a stream. Need a set instead of list - just use `Collectors.toSet()`.
```

The next example groups all persons by age:
```java
Map<Integer, List<Person>> personsByAge = persons
    .stream()
    .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(p -> p.age));

personsByAge
    .forEach((age, p) -> System.out.format("age %s: %s\n", age, p));

// age 18: [Max]
// age 23: [Peter, Pamela]
// age 12: [David]
```
Collectors are extremely versatile. You can also create aggregations on the elements of the stream, e.g. determining the average age of all persons:
```java
Double averageAge = persons
    .stream()
    .collect(Collectors.averagingInt(p -> p.age));

System.out.println(averageAge);     // 19.0
```
If you're interested in more comprehensive statistics, the summarizing collectors return a special built-in summary statistics object. So we can simply determine min, max and arithmetic average age of the persons as well as the sum and count.
```java
IntSummaryStatistics ageSummary =
    persons
        .stream()
        .collect(Collectors.summarizingInt(p -> p.age));

System.out.println(ageSummary);
// IntSummaryStatistics{count=4, sum=76, min=12, average=19.000000, max=23}
```

The next example joins all persons into a single string:
```java
String phrase = persons
    .stream()
    .filter(p -> p.age >= 18)
    .map(p -> p.name)
    .collect(Collectors.joining(" and ", "In Germany ", " are of legal age."));

System.out.println(phrase);
// In Germany Max and Peter and Pamela are of legal age.
```
The join collector accepts a delimiter as well as an optional prefix and suffix.


In order to transform the stream elements into a map, we have to specify how both the keys and the values should be mapped. Keep in mind that the mapped keys must be unique, otherwise an `IllegalStateException` is thrown. You can optionally pass a merge function as an additional parameter to bypass the exception:
```java
Map<Integer, String> map = persons
    .stream()
    .collect(Collectors.toMap(
        p -> p.age,
        p -> p.name,
        (name1, name2) -> name1 + ";" + name2));

System.out.println(map);
// {18=Max, 23=Peter;Pamela, 12=David}
```

Now that we know some of the most powerful built-in collectors, let's try to build our own special collector. We want to transform all persons of the stream into a single string consisting of all names in upper letters separated by the | pipe character. In order to achieve this we create a new collector via Collector.of(). We have to pass the four ingredients of a collector: a supplier, an accumulator, a combiner and a finisher.
```java
Collector<Person, StringJoiner, String> personNameCollector =
    Collector.of(
        () -> new StringJoiner(" | "),          // supplier
        (j, p) -> j.add(p.name.toUpperCase()),  // accumulator
        (j1, j2) -> j1.merge(j2),               // combiner
        StringJoiner::toString);                // finisher

String names = persons
    .stream()
    .collect(personNameCollector);

System.out.println(names);  // MAX | PETER | PAMELA | DAVID
```
Since strings in Java are immutable, we need a helper class like `StringJoiner` to let the collector construct our string. The supplier initially constructs such a StringJoiner with the appropriate delimiter. The accumulator is used to add each persons upper-cased name to the StringJoiner. The combiner knows how to merge two StringJoiners into one. In the last step the finisher constructs the desired String from the StringJoiner.

#### FlatMap
We've already learned how to transform the objects of a stream into another type of objects by utilizing the `map` operation. Map is kinda limited because every object can only be mapped to exactly one other object. But what if we want to transform one object into multiple others or none at all? This is where `flatMap` comes to the rescue.


FlatMap transforms each element of the stream into a stream of other objects. So each object will be transformed into zero, one or multiple other objects backed by streams. The contents of those streams will then be placed into the returned stream of the flatMap operation.

Before we see flatMap in action we need an appropriate type hierarchy:
```java
class Foo {
    String name;
    List<Bar> bars = new ArrayList<>();

    Foo(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}

class Bar {
    String name;

    Bar(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
```
Next, we utilize our knowledge about streams to instantiate a couple of objects:
```java
List<Foo> foos = new ArrayList<>();

// create foos
IntStream
    .range(1, 4)
    .forEach(i -> foos.add(new Foo("Foo" + i)));

// create bars
foos.forEach(f ->
    IntStream
        .range(1, 4)
        .forEach(i -> f.bars.add(new Bar("Bar" + i + " <- " + f.name))));
```
Now we have a list of three foos each consisting of three bars.

FlatMap accepts a function which has to return a stream of objects. So in order to resolve the bar objects of each foo, we just pass the appropriate function:
```java
foos.stream()
    .flatMap(f -> f.bars.stream())
    .forEach(b -> System.out.println(b.name));

// Bar1 <- Foo1
// Bar2 <- Foo1
// Bar3 <- Foo1
// Bar1 <- Foo2
// Bar2 <- Foo2
// Bar3 <- Foo2
// Bar1 <- Foo3
// Bar2 <- Foo3
// Bar3 <- Foo3
```
As you can see, we've successfully transformed the stream of three foo objects into a stream of nine bar objects.

Finally, the above code example can be simplified into a single pipeline of stream operations:
```java
IntStream.range(1, 4)
    .mapToObj(i -> new Foo("Foo" + i))
    .peek(f -> IntStream.range(1, 4)
        .mapToObj(i -> new Bar("Bar" + i + " <- " f.name))
        .forEach(f.bars::add))
    .flatMap(f -> f.bars.stream())
    .forEach(b -> System.out.println(b.name));
```

#### Reduce
The reduction operation combines all elements of the stream into a single result. 
* Java 8 supports three different kind of reduce methods. 
* The first one reduces a stream of elements to exactly one element of the stream.
* Let's see how we can use this method to determine the oldest person:
```java
persons
    .stream()
    .reduce((p1, p2) -> p1.age > p2.age ? p1 : p2)
    .ifPresent(System.out::println);    // Pamela
```    
The reduce method accepts a `BinaryOperator` accumulator function. That's actually a BiFunction where both operands share the same type, in that case Person. BiFunctions are like Function but accept two arguments. The example function compares both persons ages in order to return the person with the maximum age.

The second reduce method accepts both an identity value and a BinaryOperator accumulator. This method can be utilized to construct a new Person with the aggregated names and ages from all other persons in the stream:
```java
Person result =
    persons
        .stream()
        .reduce(new Person("", 0), (p1, p2) -> {
            p1.age += p2.age;
            p1.name += p2.name;
            return p1;
        });

System.out.format("name=%s; age=%s", result.name, result.age);
// name=MaxPeterPamelaDavid; age=76
```
The third reduce method accepts three parameters: an identity value, a BiFunction accumulator and a combiner function of type BinaryOperator. Since the identity values type is not restricted to the Person type, we can utilize this reduction to determine the sum of ages from all persons:
```java
Integer ageSum = persons
    .stream()
    .reduce(0, (sum, p) -> sum += p.age, (sum1, sum2) -> sum1 + sum2);

System.out.println(ageSum);  // 76
```
As you can see the result is 76, but what's happening exactly under the hood? Let's extend the above code by some debug output:
```java
Integer ageSum = persons
    .stream()
    .reduce(0,
        (sum, p) -> {
            System.out.format("accumulator: sum=%s; person=%s\n", sum, p);
            return sum += p.age;
        },
        (sum1, sum2) -> {
            System.out.format("combiner: sum1=%s; sum2=%s\n", sum1, sum2);
            return sum1 + sum2;
        });

// accumulator: sum=0; person=Max
// accumulator: sum=18; person=Peter
// accumulator: sum=41; person=Pamela
// accumulator: sum=64; person=David
```
As you can see the accumulator function does all the work. It first get called with the initial identity value 0 and the first person Max. In the next three steps sum continually increases by the age of the last steps person up to a total age of 76.

Wait wat? The combiner never gets called? Executing the same stream in parallel will lift the secret:
```java
Integer ageSum = persons
    .parallelStream()
    .reduce(0,
        (sum, p) -> {
            System.out.format("accumulator: sum=%s; person=%s\n", sum, p);
            return sum += p.age;
        },
        (sum1, sum2) -> {
            System.out.format("combiner: sum1=%s; sum2=%s\n", sum1, sum2);
            return sum1 + sum2;
        });

// accumulator: sum=0; person=Pamela
// accumulator: sum=0; person=David
// accumulator: sum=0; person=Max
// accumulator: sum=0; person=Peter
// combiner: sum1=18; sum2=23
// combiner: sum1=23; sum2=12
// combiner: sum1=41; sum2=35
```
Executing this stream in parallel results in an entirely different execution behavior. Now the combiner is actually called. Since the accumulator is called in parallel, the combiner is needed to sum up the separate accumulated values.

Let's dive deeper into parallel streams in the next chapter.


<hr>


### Parallel Streams
Streams can be executed in parallel to increase runtime performance on large amount of input elements. Parallel streams use a common ForkJoinPool available via the static ForkJoinPool.commonPool() method. The size of the underlying thread-pool uses up to five threads - depending on the amount of available physical CPU cores:
```java
ForkJoinPool commonPool = ForkJoinPool.commonPool();
System.out.println(commonPool.getParallelism());    // 3
```
On my machine the common pool is initialized with a parallelism of 3 per default. This value can be decreased or increased by setting the following JVM parameter:
```java
-Djava.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool.common.parallelism=5
```
Collections support the method parallelStream() to create a parallel stream of elements. Alternatively you can call the intermediate method parallel() on a given stream to convert a sequential stream to a parallel counterpart.

In order to understate the parallel execution behavior of a parallel stream the next example prints information about the current thread to sout:
```java
Arrays.asList("a1", "a2", "b1", "c2", "c1")
    .parallelStream()
    .filter(s -> {
        System.out.format("filter: %s [%s]\n",
            s, Thread.currentThread().getName());
        return true;
    })
    .map(s -> {
        System.out.format("map: %s [%s]\n",
            s, Thread.currentThread().getName());
        return s.toUpperCase();
    })
    .forEach(s -> System.out.format("forEach: %s [%s]\n",
        s, Thread.currentThread().getName()));
```
By investigating the debug output we should get a better understanding which threads are actually used to execute the stream operations:
```java
filter:  b1 [main]
filter:  a2 [ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-1]
map:     a2 [ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-1]
filter:  c2 [ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-3]
map:     c2 [ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-3]
filter:  c1 [ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-2]
map:     c1 [ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-2]
forEach: C2 [ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-3]
forEach: A2 [ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-1]
map:     b1 [main]
forEach: B1 [main]
filter:  a1 [ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-3]
map:     a1 [ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-3]
forEach: A1 [ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-3]
forEach: C1 [ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-2]
```
As you can see the parallel stream utilizes all available threads from the common ForkJoinPool for executing the stream operations. The output may differ in consecutive runs because the behavior which particular thread is actually used is non-deterministic.

Let's extend the example by an additional stream operation, sort:
```java
Arrays.asList("a1", "a2", "b1", "c2", "c1")
    .parallelStream()
    .filter(s -> {
        System.out.format("filter: %s [%s]\n",
            s, Thread.currentThread().getName());
        return true;
    })
    .map(s -> {
        System.out.format("map: %s [%s]\n",
            s, Thread.currentThread().getName());
        return s.toUpperCase();
    })
    .sorted((s1, s2) -> {
        System.out.format("sort: %s <> %s [%s]\n",
            s1, s2, Thread.currentThread().getName());
        return s1.compareTo(s2);
    })
    .forEach(s -> System.out.format("forEach: %s [%s]\n",
        s, Thread.currentThread().getName()));
```
The result may look strange at first:
```java
filter:  c2 [ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-3]
filter:  c1 [ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-2]
map:     c1 [ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-2]
filter:  a2 [ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-1]
map:     a2 [ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-1]
filter:  b1 [main]
map:     b1 [main]
filter:  a1 [ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-2]
map:     a1 [ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-2]
map:     c2 [ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-3]
sort:    A2 <> A1 [main]
sort:    B1 <> A2 [main]
sort:    C2 <> B1 [main]
sort:    C1 <> C2 [main]
sort:    C1 <> B1 [main]
sort:    C1 <> C2 [main]
forEach: A1 [ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-1]
forEach: C2 [ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-3]
forEach: B1 [main]
forEach: A2 [ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-2]
forEach: C1 [ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-1]
```
It seems that sort is executed sequentially on the main thread only. Actually, sort on a parallel stream uses the new Java 8 method Arrays.parallelSort() under the hood. As stated in Javadoc this method decides on the length of the array if sorting will be performed sequentially or in parallel:

If the length of the specified array is less than the minimum granularity, then it is sorted using the appropriate Arrays.sort method.

Coming back to the reduce example from the last section. We already found out that the combiner function is only called in parallel but not in sequential streams. Let's see which threads are actually involved:
```java
List<Person> persons = Arrays.asList(
    new Person("Max", 18),
    new Person("Peter", 23),
    new Person("Pamela", 23),
    new Person("David", 12));

persons
    .parallelStream()
    .reduce(0,
        (sum, p) -> {
            System.out.format("accumulator: sum=%s; person=%s [%s]\n",
                sum, p, Thread.currentThread().getName());
            return sum += p.age;
        },
        (sum1, sum2) -> {
            System.out.format("combiner: sum1=%s; sum2=%s [%s]\n",
                sum1, sum2, Thread.currentThread().getName());
            return sum1 + sum2;
        });
```        
The console output reveals that both the accumulator and the combiner functions are executed in parallel on all available threads:
```java
accumulator: sum=0; person=Pamela; [main]
accumulator: sum=0; person=Max;    [ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-3]
accumulator: sum=0; person=David;  [ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-2]
accumulator: sum=0; person=Peter;  [ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-1]
combiner:    sum1=18; sum2=23;     [ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-1]
combiner:    sum1=23; sum2=12;     [ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-2]
combiner:    sum1=41; sum2=35;     [ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-2]
```
In summary, it can be stated that parallel streams can bring be a nice performance boost to streams with a large amount of input elements. But keep in mind that some parallel stream operations like reduce and collect need additional computations (combine operations) which isn't needed when executed sequentially.

Furthermore we've learned that all parallel stream operations share the same JVM-wide common ForkJoinPool. So you probably want to avoid implementing slow blocking stream operations since that could potentially slow down other parts of your application which rely heavily on parallel streams.
